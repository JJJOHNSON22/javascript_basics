            <h1>JavaScript Basics</h1>
            <p class="mainlist">JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. JavaScript is extremely
                 popular for a variety of reasons. it is small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility
                  for developers to take it in a bunch of different directions. JavaScript lives inside a host environment
                   (a web browser or Node server), it can be connected to the objects of these environments to provide
                    programmatic control over them.</p>
            <ul>
                <li class="mainlist"><u>Variable Declaration</u><p class="listtext">JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values
                     - imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds a value. All JavaScript
                      variables must be identified with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers. <c>var x;</c></p>
                </li>

                <li class="mainlist"><u>Variable Assignment</u><p class="listtext">Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript
                     variables - our cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our variable a value to hold. The = assignment
                    operator assigns a value to a variable. <c>var x = 10;</c></p>
                </li>
                    
                <li class="mainlist"><u>Data Types</u><p class="listtext">Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables
                    you need to know the data type. there are six data types that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean - <c>true</c> or <c>false;</c>
                    null - <c>null</c> aka nothing; Number - <c>42</c> or <c>3.14159;</c> String - <c>"Coding Dojo Rocks!";</c> Array -
                    <c>[1, 'Coding', 2, 'Dojo'];</c> and Object - <c>{first_name: 'Jane', last_name: 'Doe"}</c></p>
                </li>

                <li class="mainlist"><u>Conditionals</u><p class="listtext">When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different
                    decisions - hitting different code blocks based on values or conditions that have been met. You can use conditional 
                    statements in your code to accomplish this. There are the following conditional statements: <c>if</c> a specified condition is true,
                    do this code in our code block; <c>else if</c> to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false; 
                    <c>else</c> we execute this block of code;</p>
                </li>

                <li class="mainlist"><u>Loops</u><p class="listtext">There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they
                    all essentially do the same thing: they will repeat an action some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run 
                    around the track four times and then you stop. That's a loop!</p>
                </li>

                <li class="mainlist"><u>Function</u><p class="listtext">Function are an encapsulation of a code block. When we call our function this will run
                    that code block. Think of it as a list of instructions. As an example imagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea, we open up the 
                    instruction manual and get started, first we screw the legs to the table top; next we place the table the right way up. Done! We finished our
                    instructions. Sadly there are a ton more tables to do so lets all our function over and over and over again.
                </p>
